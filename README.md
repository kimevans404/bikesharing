# bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis
A proposal has been made to start a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, and an analysis of bike-sharing in New York City will be used to show investors that it is a solid business proposal. The NYC bike-sharing data was pulled from [this website](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) made available by citibike, and the analysis was performed with Tableau.
The Tableau Story for this analysis can be viewed [here.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kimber.evans/viz/Bikesharing_Challenge_16705526505010/Story1)

## Results
Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

Using only one month of data there is a very clear picture showing the success of this program. 

### Trips and Usertype

In this visualization we can see that there were 2,344,224 trips in August 2019 in New York City. 80% of those trips were made by users with subscriptions which shows that 1 out of every 5 rides is a user who hasn't subscribed. The gender of users is 65% male and 25% female with 10% unknown. Going forward we will review total usage and usage by gender. 


### Trip Duration

It is most common for bike trips to be less than one hour, and the majority of those trips are less than 10 minutes. There is some data (not shown) where trips may last over 2 hours (less than 100 trips per minute), and also some usage (less than 50 users) was between 23 and 24 hours.

### Trip Duration by Gender

Here we can see the breakdown of trip duration by a user's gender. Knowing that 65% of usage in the month was male explains why the spike on the graph nearly matches the overall trip duration from the previous visualization, but we can see a very similar drop off of time used for females as well. 

### Total Usage by Weekday
